        "-------------------------------\n",
        "You have seen how a polynomial kernel of degree 2 can map the original 2D data\n",
        "$$(x_1, x_2)$$\n",
        "to a 3D feature space via some transformation\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\phi(\\mathbf{x}).\n",
        "$$\n",
        "You also saw that **the decision boundary** in the 3D space—expected to be a hyperplane—**appears** as a circular surface when visualized.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Primary Question**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why does the SVM's decision boundary in the higher-dimensional (3D) feature space *not* look like a “flat” hyperplane,**\n",
        "even though we *know* the classifier’s separating surface *is* mathematically linear in that space?\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Secondary Question**\n",
        "\n",
        "Explain **why** a hyperplane in 3D becomes a **circular (or elliptical) curve** when viewed back in the original 2D plane of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Task & Deliverables**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Colab Notebook**  \n",
        "   - Create a **Colab notebook** that:\n",
        "     - Clearly **answers** both the **primary** and **secondary** questions with appropriate plots and short explanations.\n",
        "     - Uses Python code to visualise and create plots.\n",
        "   - Include a discussion (in markdown cells) illustrating the geometry behind the mapping\n",
        "     $$\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
        "     and the resulting decision boundary.\n",
        "   - Use\n",
        "     `$` symbol to delimit inline equations and `$$` to delimit full-line equations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Publish on GitHub**  \n",
        "   - Place the Colab notebook in your **GitHub repository** for this course.\n",
        "   - In your repository’s **README**, add a **link** to the notebook and also include an **“Open in Colab”** badge at the top of the notebook so it can be launched directly from GitHub.\n",

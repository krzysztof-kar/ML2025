        "-------------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "You are provided with a dataset containing 3-dimensional data points from three distinct classes. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:\n",

        "Each data point is represented by three continuous features $(x, y, z)$ and belongs to one of three clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Primary Question**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Perform PCA on the provided dataset to find the two principal components and visualize the data in a 2D plot using these components.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compare this PCA plot with the following 2D plots of the original data:\n",
        "  - $x$ vs. $y$\n",

        "\n",
        "## **Secondary Question**\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember: before applying PCA, **standardize** the data so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is standardization necessary before applying PCA?**\n",
        "\n",

        "## **Task & Deliverables**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Colab Notebook**  \n",
        "   - Create a **Colab notebook** that:\n",
        "     - Performs PCA on the dataset and visualizes the first two principal components in a 2D scatter plot.\n",
        "     - Includes separate 2D scatter plots for the original feature pairs: $(x, y)$, $(x, z)$, and $(y, z)$.\n",
        "     - Clearly **answers** both the **primary** and **secondary** questions.\n",
        "     - Uses Python code to perform PCA, standardize the data, and generate the required plots.\n",
        "   - To answer the primary question, you may consider creating additional visualizations or charts beyond those listed above. For example, some students might choose to explore a 3D plot of the data. Feel free to experiment with different approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Publish on GitHub**  \n",
        "   - Place the Colab notebook in your **GitHub repository** for this course.\n",
        "   - In your repository’s **README**, add a **link** to the notebook and include an **“Open in Colab”** badge in your notebook, so it can be launched directly from GitHub.\n",
